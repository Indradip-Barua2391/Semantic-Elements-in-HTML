          <h2>Facts About AI (Artificial Intelligence)</h2>
          <p>
            artificial intelligence (AI), the ability of a digital computer or
            computer-controlled robot to perform tasks commonly associated with
            intelligent beings. The term is frequently applied to the project of
            developing systems endowed with the intellectual processes
            characteristic of humans, such as the ability to reason, discover
            meaning, generalize, or learn from past experience. Since their
            development in the 1940s, digital computers have been programmed to
            carry out very complex tasks—such as discovering proofs for
            mathematical theorems or playing chess—with great proficiency.
            Despite continuing advances in computer processing speed and memory
            capacity, there are as yet no programs that can match full human
            flexibility over wider domains or in tasks requiring much everyday
            knowledge. On the other hand, some programs have attained the
            performance levels of human experts and professionals in executing
            certain specific tasks, so that artificial intelligence in this
            limited sense is found in applications as diverse as medical
            diagnosis, computer search engines, voice or handwriting
            recognition, and chatbots.

          <h2>What is Intelligence?</h2>
          <p>
            All but the simplest human behavior is ascribed to intelligence,
            while even the most complicated insect behavior is usually not taken
            as an indication of intelligence. What is the difference? Consider
            the behavior of the digger wasp, Sphex ichneumoneus. When the female
            wasp returns to her burrow with food, she first deposits it on the
            threshold, checks for intruders inside her burrow, and only then, if
            the coast is clear, carries her food inside. The real nature of the
            wasp’s instinctual behavior is revealed if the food is moved a few
            inches away from the entrance to her burrow while she is inside: on
            emerging, she will repeat the whole procedure as often as the food
            is displaced. Intelligence—conspicuously absent in the case of the
            wasp—must include the ability to adapt to new circumstances.

      <h2>Learning</h2>
      <p>
        There are a number of different forms of learning as applied to
        artificial intelligence. The simplest is learning by trial and error.
        For example, a simple computer program for solving mate-in-one chess
        problems might try moves at random until mate is found. The program
        might then store the solution with the position so that, the next time
        the computer encountered the same position, it would recall the
        solution. This simple memorizing of individual items and
        procedures—known as rote learning—is relatively easy to implement on a
        computer. More challenging is the problem of implementing what is called
        generalization. Generalization involves applying past experience to
        analogous new situations. For example, a program that learns the past
        tense of regular English verbs by rote will not be able to produce the
        past tense of a word such as jump unless the program was previously
        presented with jumped, whereas a program that is able to generalize can
        learn the “add -ed” rule for regular verbs ending in a consonant and so
        form the past tense of jump on the basis of experience with similar
        verbs.

      <h2>Reasoning</h2>

      <p>
        To reason is to draw inferences appropriate to the situation. Inferences
        are classified as either deductive or inductive. An example of the
        former is, “Fred must be in either the museum or the café. He is not in
        the café; therefore, he is in the museum,” and of the latter is,
        “Previous accidents of this sort were caused by instrument failure. This
        accident is of the same sort; therefore, it was likely caused by
        instrument failure.” The most significant difference between these forms
        of reasoning is that in the deductive case, the truth of the premises
        guarantees the truth of the conclusion, whereas in the inductive case,
        the truth of the premises lends support to the conclusion without giving
        absolute assurance. Inductive reasoning is common in science, where data
        are collected and tentative models are developed to describe and predict
        future behavior—until the appearance of anomalous data forces the model
        to be revised. Deductive reasoning is common in mathematics and logic,
        where elaborate structures of irrefutable theorems are built up from a
        small set of basic axioms and rules.

      <h2>Problem solving</h2>
      <p>
        Problem solving, particularly in artificial intelligence, may be
        characterized as a systematic search through a range of possible actions
        in order to reach some predefined goal or solution. Problem-solving
        methods divide into special purpose and general purpose. A
        special-purpose method is tailor-made for a particular problem and often
        exploits very specific features of the situation in which the problem is
        embedded. In contrast, a general-purpose method is applicable to a wide
        variety of problems. One general-purpose technique used in AI is
        means-end analysis—a step-by-step, or incremental, reduction of the
        difference between the current state and the final goal. The program
        selects actions from a list of means—in the case of a simple robot, this
        might consist of PICKUP, PUTDOWN, MOVEFORWARD, MOVEBACK, MOVELEFT, and
        MOVERIGHT—until the goal is reached.
